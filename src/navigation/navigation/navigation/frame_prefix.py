"""Prefix Nav2 TF frames that live under the robot, leave `map` global.

Topics are namespaced by launch. Frames are not. Bringup publishes
`{ns}/odom` → `{ns}/base_footprint` (D-4); stock nav2_params.yaml still
says `odom` / `base_footprint`. AMCL then never sees a transform.

Sensor topics named inside a costmap plugin are the exception to "topics are
namespaced by launch". A costmap's observation source resolves its topic
against the **costmap node's** namespace, not the robot's, so `scan` became
`/{ns}/global_costmap/scan` — a topic nobody publishes. The obstacle layers
took no observation at all and nav2 drove on the static map alone: two robots
walked into each other at every corridor width from 1.4 m down to 0.7 m, and
the planner never once reported a blockage because, to it, the corridor was
empty. Absolute `/scan` fixes the device (no namespace); this module carries
the same rewrite to the namespaced sim.
