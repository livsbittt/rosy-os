"""`RosBridge` must implement every member the executor contracts declare.

This is the test that would have caught D-32 at its root. `NavExecutor` and
`DockingExecutor` are `typing.Protocol`s and `RosBridge` declares no base class,
so conformance is duck-typed and nothing — not the type system, not CI, not the
host suite — notices when a member is missing. `reset_mapping` was absent for
the whole life of the endpoint that called it, hidden behind a `hasattr` probe;
removing the probe removes the hiding place but not the underlying exposure. Add
a member to a Protocol, forget the bridge, call it as `self.executor.foo()`, and
you have reproduced D-32 with no `hasattr` anywhere for C6 to find.

`bridge/AGENTS.md` records why an import-based check is not available here: host
pytest cannot import `ros_bridge.py`, because rclpy is not installed on the dev
machine and is optional in the core image. So this reads the source with `ast`,
the same technique and for the same reason as `test_module_criteria.py`.

That makes it a structural check, not a behavioural one: it proves the method
exists, never that it does the right thing. `RosBridge.reset_mapping` is still
verified by nothing on either platform — it is unreachable on all three deploy
overlays, which are `slam: false`. This test closes the omission, not the gap.
