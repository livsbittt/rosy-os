"""Structural harness: what `RosBridge.__init__` registers on the node.

**Read this before extending it.** The plan that produced this file rejected a
stubbed-rclpy harness as a *strategy*, for four reasons that have not gone away:
tests against a stub assert stub semantics; QoS, `MultiThreadedExecutor`
re-entrancy, timer scheduling and action futures are exactly what makes the
bridge risky and exactly what a stub erases; it forks an unvalidated rclpy
surface in-tree; and its maintenance cost grows with every message type.

It survived as **one concession**: a stub is the only credible way to make the
3b adapter reshape gradable without a robot, because it can assert that
`__init__` still registers the same timers at the same periods. Structural, not
semantic. That is the whole mandate.

So:

- **Do not** add a test here that calls a callback, drives a tick, or asserts on
  a message value. Those belong in the ROS-free siblings (`translate.py`,
  `display.py`, `reconcile.py`, `odometry.py`, `save_map.py`,
  `battery_policy.py`, `goal_tracker.py`), where no stub is involved.
- **Do not** move the stub into `conftest.py`. It lives in this file so its
  blast radius is this file: nothing else can start depending on stub
  semantics by accident.
- The periods below are the contract. `1/50` is D-2, the sole `cmd_vel`
  publisher, and a reshape that changes it is the failure this exists to catch.
- Every literal here is read off `ros_bridge.py`, never pasted from this
  harness's own output. A baseline derived from the thing it checks ratifies
  whatever that thing currently does — which is how an undeclared costmap
  change once got pinned without anyone reviewing it.

What it still cannot see, so that nobody mistakes green for verified: whether a
callback *does* the right thing, whether QoS means what the profile says on a
real DDS, and anything about executor re-entrancy or action futures. It proves
the wiring diagram, not the wiring.
