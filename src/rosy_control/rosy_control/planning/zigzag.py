"""Subject: zigzag mapping. Boustrophedon coverage of the mapped free space.

Lanes run along the longer map axis at lane_width pitch (robot swath ~15 cm,
lane_width 0.12 m overlaps). Serpentine order starts at the lane nearest the
robot; connectors between waypoints are planned separately (best_route).
covered cells are excluded before lane building, so replanning with a fresh
covered set advances coverage instead of repeating it.

        Used when coverage is done but the world may still be bigger than
        the map: driving there pushes the sensor envelope outward.

        The region flood is 8-conn and may cross corner-cut diagonals A*
        cannot drive (best_route forbids cutting corners), so a probe on
        one of those dead-flood cells returned best_route=None at every
        clearance and the loop sat frozen on 'coverage done'. Farthest by
        walk distance uses best_route's own connectivity, so the raw-map
        route always exists. walk_min_m skips cells within the driver's
        arrival tolerance so standing on the target can't re-deadlock.

        covered (sim rig): cells already swept are skipped, so the probe
        ADVANCES — the farthest-walk cell otherwise stays the same cell
        after the robot stands on it and the loop re-picks it forever.
        straight_min_m optionally rejects walk-far-but-straight-near cells
        (a point 2 cm away across a wall corner); None keeps the plain
        walk-farthest contract. Failing that gate, the walk-farthest cell
        is still returned — an imperfect probe beats 'coverage done'.

        The gates filter only the target pick, never the expansion: an
        early continue once truncated the flood at the start cell's own
        neighbours (all straight-near) and probe_point returned None — or
        worse, a next-door cell — on every map.
