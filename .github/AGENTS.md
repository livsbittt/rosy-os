# .github

## Purpose

GitHub Actions for colcon build, lint, pytest, and `core` boot smoke on ROS 2 Jazzy.

## Key Files

None at this level.

## Subdirectories

| Directory | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `workflows/` | CI workflow definitions (see `workflows/AGENTS.md`) |

## For AI Agents

### Working In This Directory

- The runner is `ros:jazzy-ros-base` and **must not** have `slam_toolbox` installed; the boot smoke asserts the log line `slam_toolbox unavailable`.
- Install OpenSSL explicitly in CI — release signing needs OpenSSL 3 Ed25519.

### Testing Requirements

Push/PR to `main` runs the workflow. Reproduce locally with the same pytest commands as in `ci.yml`.

### Common Patterns

Comments in `ci.yml` document why extra steps exist (root `test/` used to be skipped; SaveMap SIGABRT). Keep those comments if you change the job.

## Dependencies

### Internal

- Builds `src/`, tests the core package tests (`src/core/core/test`) and repo-root `test/`

### External

- GitHub Actions, `ros:jazzy-ros-base` container
