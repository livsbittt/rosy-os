"""What BUILD_GO actually checks, run against a mounted image tree (WP-6).

The design lists the image inspections in section 12.2, and they are the
difference between "an image was produced" and "an image that is safe to
write to a card". Every one of them is a question about a directory tree, so
they run here against a fabricated tree in a test and against a real
``losetup``/``mount`` on the build host — same code, same verdicts.

This does not build anything and cannot. Producing the image needs a native
ARM64 host; this is the gate that decides whether what came out is shippable.

Two checks are worth calling out because they encode decisions made
elsewhere and would otherwise be forgotten in the image:

* ``rosy-release-recover.service`` must be enabled *and* the runtime unit must
  require it. With ``Wants=`` a held device boots its runtime anyway and the
  hold becomes advisory.
* The account CORE runs as must not be the login account. SO_PEERCRED proves
  "a process with this uid", so if that uid is the Pi's default login user,
  the Host Agent's authentication is worth no more than an SSH session.
