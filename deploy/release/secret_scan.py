"""Scan release inputs for embedded secrets.

The ROSY OS v1 release contract forbids per-device secrets in anything that
ships: no shared password, no shared API token, no Wi-Fi PSK, no SSH private
key in the repository, the container images or the SD image
(see the image/release design, sections 2.7, 12.1 and 12.2).

This module is the single scanner behind both checks. The repository check
runs in CI over tracked files; the image check (WP-6) will run the same
matchers over a mounted image tree. Keeping one implementation means a
pattern added for one check protects the other.

The scanner is deliberately conservative about placeholders: a config
template that says ``password: <your-wifi-password>`` is the correct thing
for a repository to contain, and flagging it would train people to ignore
the scanner.
