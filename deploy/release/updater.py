"""Release activation, rollback and power-loss recovery (WP-2).

Activation is the moment an update can leave a robot unbootable, so the order
here is deliberate and the journal is written before anything moves.

The sequence, matching the design's activation procedure:

1. Record the old activation, the candidate activation and the display
   pointers in the journal, and flush it.
2. Stop the running runtime.
3. Replace ``activation.json`` atomically with the candidate.
4. Repoint the cosmetic ``current``/``previous`` symlinks.
5. Start the candidate in ``core`` mode and health-check it under a bound.
6. On success, mark ``previous`` and complete the journal.
7. On failure, restore the old activation record atomically, restore the
   pointers and bring the previous release back up in ``core``.

If power is lost anywhere in the middle, :meth:`Updater.recover` reads the
journal on the next boot and finishes the story before the runtime is allowed
to start. That ordering is why ``rosy-release-recover.service`` must run
before ``rosy-runtime.service``, with the runtime depending on it — otherwise
a half-activated device boots a candidate nobody ever health-checked.

Neither activation nor rollback ever restores ``motor`` or ``hardware``. Both
end core-only, and returning to a hardware mode is a separate field approval.

Runtime control and health checking are injected so the whole sequence runs
in a temporary directory, including the failure paths that are impractical to
provoke on real hardware.
