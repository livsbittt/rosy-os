"""Transport and privileged execution for the Host Agent (WP-4).

Kept apart from ``host_agent`` on purpose. Everything that decides *whether* to
act lives there and runs anywhere; this file owns the two things that need a
real Linux host — the unix socket with its ownership and mode, and the actual
``nmcli`` / ``systemctl`` / ``reboot`` calls.

The split is what lets the refusal logic be tested exhaustively without a
Raspberry Pi, and it keeps the privileged surface small enough to read in one
sitting.
