"""Privilege- and secret-boundary guards for the ROSY OS release contract.

Two boundaries in the image/release design are cheap to state and expensive
to lose:

* CORE is the robot API, not a host administrator. It must not own ``/dev``
  devices, the Docker socket, or host root (design sections 2.13, 4.2, 12.1).
  A future Host Agent gets those responsibilities as a separate least-
  privilege process.
* Nothing that ships carries a secret — no shared password, no shared API
  token, no Wi-Fi PSK, no SSH private key (design sections 2.7, 12.1, 12.2).

Today's ``compose.yaml`` already satisfies the first. These tests exist to
keep it that way: the boundary is one convenience mount away from being gone,
and the loss would not be obvious in review.

``test_robot_runtime.py`` also asserts parts of this, but by exact string
(``"/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock" not in mounts``). That form
passes the moment someone writes the same mount with a ``:ro`` suffix or via
``/run/docker.sock``. The checks here are structural instead.
